# I created an exe file that goes to the portfolio url I created using the webbrowser module. When using the web browser module, I specified the url part with the open cursor.

# First of all we need python.  After completing the Python installation, we integrate our code into the system and check if it works.

 import webbrowser as web

web.open('https://malikagan48.github.io/Portfolio/')

# In order to create an exe, we need to open a command prompt first. We can open it by typing cmd in the search box. Now we are doing the pip install. We write  (pip install pyinstaller) as in the picture. It looks like in the picture because I installed it before. If you start the installation, it will install without a problem.

# In this part, I determine where my file is saved and take it to the desktop for ease of operation. After I move my folder to the desktop, I specify this on the cmd screen as in the picture and I start downloading pyinstall. Since my file is named main file, I am writing the following command here (pyinstaller --onefile main.py)
